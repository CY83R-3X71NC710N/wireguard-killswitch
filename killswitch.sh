# WireGuard Kill Switch for macOS (Auto MTU 1280 Detect) - v5 (No-Log IP Service)
# ===========================================
#
# This script creates a kill switch for WireGuard VPN on macOS using PF (Packet Filter).
# It automatically detects the 'utun' interface with MTU 1280.
# It ensures that traffic only flows through the VPN when active.
# It sends a macOS notification upon activation with interface name and public IP.
#
# Usage:
#   ./killswitch.sh
#
# Environment variables for configuration:
#   WIREGUARD_PORT - WireGuard server port (default: 51820)
#   PF_RULES_PATH - Path to PF rules file (default: /etc/pf.anchors/wireguard_killswitch)
#   PUBLIC_IP_SERVICE - URL to fetch public IP (default: https://api.ipify.org)
#
# Requirements:
#   - macOS operating system
#   - WireGuard installed
#   - Administrative privileges (sudo)
#   - curl (for public IP fetching)

# Check if running on macOS
if [[ "$(uname)" != "Darwin" ]]; then
